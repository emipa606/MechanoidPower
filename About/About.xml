Another self-sufficient supply for the energy hungry:

[h1]The Mechanoid Power Source[/h1]

Adds a third option to the game with a nasty ship part falling from the skies, which has a 33% chance to go off on shipwreck incidents. Adds an unique drop to the crashed ship part: The Mechanoid Power Cell, which allows the construction of a passive power generating structure. Requires a research (Mechanoid power source) to implement the cell into a Power Generator.

 - 300 Steel
 - 200 Plasteel
 - Mechanoid Power Cell
  (Obtained through crashed ship parts on an incident)
