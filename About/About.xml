--- Original Description ---	
Another self-sufficient supply for the energy hungry:

&lt;b&gt;&lt;color=#01fc61&gt;The Mechanoid Power Source&lt;/color&gt;&lt;/b&gt;

Adds a third option to the game with a nasty ship part falling from the skies, which has a 33% chance to go off on shipwreck incidents. Adds an unique drop to the crashed ship part: The Mechanoid Power Cell, which allows the construction of a passive power generating structure. Requires a research (Mechanoid power source) to implement the cell into a Power Generator.

&lt;b&gt;Costs&lt;/b&gt;

 - 300 Steel
 - 200 Plasteel
 - Mechanoid Power Cell
  (Obtained through crashed ship parts on an incident)

&lt;b&gt;Properties&lt;/b&gt;

 - Produces 5000W
 - Glow effect on power
 - Can break down
 - Produces intense heat
 - High market value (2k)
 - Instable on gunfire and explosions (250 HP)
 - Needs Security &amp; Protection
 
Prerequisites are Microelectronics, Hightech Laboratory and Multi Analyzer.
(Advanced colonies only)

&lt;b&gt;Supported Mods&lt;/b&gt;

 - More Crashed Ship Parts (New loot + MPC, when loaded before)
 - Get your Turret addon with Mechanoid Master Blaster (load this after)
  
&lt;b&gt;Overview&lt;/b&gt;

 - Vanilla oriented
 - Can be added to a savegame
 - Can be removed, but its not recommend :-)
 - English/German Translations available
 - Will automatically balance to your actual game state/progress
 - Works flowless on my dozens of tests
 - Configurable under Options

Ever wanted to be happy about a space ship crashing in your garden yard? This is it.
