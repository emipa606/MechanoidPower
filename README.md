Another self-sufficient supply for the energy hungry:

# The Mechanoid Power Source


Adds a third option to the game with a nasty ship part falling from the skies, which has a 33% chance to go off on shipwreck incidents. Adds an unique drop to the crashed ship part: The Mechanoid Power Cell, which allows the construction of a passive power generating structure. Requires a research (Mechanoid power source) to implement the cell into a Power Generator.

**Properties**

 - Produces 5000W
 - Glow effect on power
 - Can break down

 - High market value (2k)
 - Needs Security and Protection
 - Instable on gunfire and explosions (250 HP)

Prerequisites are Microelectronics, Hightech Laboratory and Multi Analyzer.
